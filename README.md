 ## Description
 This is a browser based Note Taker application


 ## Technologies Used  
 JavaScript
 NodeJS 
 Express

 ## Installation

 Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
 Pull the Repository
 Initialize npm by typing ```npm init```
 After that command runs a series of processes, you're ready to use npm.
 Type ```npm install express``` on the root of the repo you've just pulled. This will fetch express making it possible for Node to use the functionality provided by the express package. 
 The application should look something like this:
 Let's now run ```npm run``` on your terminal (make sure you're on the same directory as the 'server.js' file when you run the command)

That should cover it !
